#### notes about the code ideas in programming languages
  * functional programming

  * sml
    - syntax is just how you write sth
    - **semantics** is what that something means
      + Type-checking rules (before program runs) in current static environment
        - what type a binding has
        - produces a type or fail
        -

      + Evaluation rules (**assuming it does type check**, how does it perform computation in order to produce a result
        - how a binding is evaluated
        - a value or an error or an infinite loop
        - look up value in current dynamic environment

    - REPL  -> quick try-something-out
    - Recursion


#### docs
  * standard ML
    - SPC m s b -> Send buffer to REPL
    - ctr-c ctr-s -> send buffer to REPL
    - ctr-d -> stop REPL
    - C-c M-o in the REPL buffer
